== Storing Database File
The database file that you create might contain highly sensitive data and must be stored in a very secure way. You must make sure that the database is always protected with a strong and long password. The database file that is protected with a strong and long password is secure and encrypted while stored on your computer or cloud storage service.

Make sure that the database file is stored in a folder that is secure. Make sure that you or someone else does not accidentally delete the database file. Deletion of the database file results in a lot of inconvenience because you will need to manually retrieve the lost information for your various web applications. You must not share your database file with anyone unless absolutely necessary.

==  Backing up Database File
It is a good practice to create copies of your database file and store the copies of your database on different computer, smart phone, or cloud storage space such a Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.

Creating backups for your database give you a peace of mind should you lose one copy of your database. You can quickly retrieve the copy of your database and start using it.

==  Sharing Database File
If there is a need to share the database file with anyone, make sure that it is protected with a strong password. It is recommended that you also protect your database file with a Key file as well.

NOTE: Do not share the database file, password, and the Key File in a single communication. Send them separately through different messages.
